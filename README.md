# Hybrid-Human-in-the-Loop-Tagging-Pipeline
The goal is to create a system that automatically tags security-related user inputs (like incident reports or queries) using NLP/ML models and then allows human experts to validate or correct those tags. The validated data is then used to retrain the models, creating a closed-loop system.


# 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
Tools: Pandas, spaCy, Scikit-learn
Goal: Load and preprocess security-related user inputs (e.g., incident reports, queries) and existing tags.
# Why?
spaCy: Efficient NLP for entity extraction (identifies security-specific terms like "ransomware").
Text Cleaning: Standardizes input for model consistency.

# 2. Model Development (Auto-Tagging)
Tools: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
Goal: Fine-tune a BERT model to predict threat type and severity.
# Why?
BERT: State-of-the-art for text classification; captures context in security reports.
Label Mapping: Converts threat type/severity combinations (e.g., "malware_high") into model-friendly IDs.

# 3. Human Validation Interface
Tools: Flask, React, SQLite
Goal: Build a web app for experts to review/correct tags.

Backend (Flask API): PYTHON
Frontend (React Component):
# Why?
Flask + React: Lightweight and scalable for internal tools.
SQLite: Stores corrected tags for retraining (minimal setup).

# 4. Feedback Loop & Retraining
Tools: Apache Airflow, Scikit-learn
Goal: Retrain model weekly with new validated tags.
# Why?
Airflow: Manages scheduled retraining (aligns with "reinforcement learning" in the job description).
Incremental Learning: New tags improve model accuracy over time.

# 5. Deployment & Monitoring
Tools: Docker, Grafana, Kubernetes
Steps:
Containerize the Flask API and React app:
Deploy on Kubernetes for scalability.

# Monitor with Grafana:
Track auto_tag_accuracy (auto vs. validated tags).
Measure human_correction_rate (frequency of manual edits).

# 6. Testing
Unit Tests: Validate BERT predictions against known examples.
Integration Tests: Ensure the Flask API and React app communicate correctly.
User Testing: Security experts assess interface usability and correction workflow.

# Why This Workflow?
Human-in-the-loop: Manual validation ensures high-quality signals.
Collaboration: Engineers deploy the pipeline; product teams use accuracy metrics.
Scalability: Kubernetes handles enterprise-level traffic.
Closed-Loop System: Retraining with validated data creates a "reinforcement learning" cycle.
